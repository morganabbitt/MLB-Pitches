# Is your Pitcher Predictable?

You could say pitching is one of the most important aspects of Baseball. They are involved in every defensive play, and based on ERA their performance makes a big difference in the flow of a game. But how can you tell how effective a pitcher is? 

This study will take a look at each pitcher in Major League Baseball and attempt to predict whether or not they are predictable. 
Using Pitch data from the 2015-2018 season we will predict the next pitch for each pitcher and depending on how well we are able to do so, we will determine how effective each pitcher is. 


This study is going to take a look at all of the different pitchers in Major League Baseball and attempt to predict their pitch types. If your pitcher is predictable, they are going to be easier to hit off of. If your pitcher is not predictable then we know they are valuable.
